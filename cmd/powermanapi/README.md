# Powermanapi: A Powerman/PowerAPI gateway server

This service provides the ability to control [Powerman](https://github.com/chaos/powerman) via the PowerAPI REST-ful API.  This allows for REST-ful control for power states of the many different platforms supported by Powerman.  The API uses direct Go bindings for `libpowerman` that can be found at `pkg/powerman` in this repository.
