# pmshell

`pmshell` is a simple re-iteration of the `pm`/`powerman` command included in [powerman](https://github.com/chaos/powerman).

`pmshell` is probably not as good as `pm`.  It mostly exists to test the `powerman` bindings in this package.

`pmshell` is a shell-like interface and can perform multiple commands with one connection.
